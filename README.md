# Whalies
Humpback Whales Project

This is the Kaggle Humpback whales project that I'm trying to learn from and see how I can improve on this~!

## Repository contents

+ `visualisation-of-siamese-net.ipynb`
    + An iPython notebook from ZFTurbo detailing about Siamese net 
    + Used for seeing whale tails!
    + And how they identify different tails of the whales
