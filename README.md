Humpback Whales Project: https://www.kaggle.com/c/humpback-whale-identification

This is the Kaggle Humpback whales project that I'm trying to learn from and see how I can improve on this~!

## Repository contents

+ `visualisation-of-siamese-net.ipynb`
    + An iPython notebook from ZFTurbo detailing about Siamese net 
    + Used for seeing whale tails!
    + And how they identify different tails of the whales
    + As you can see from the visualization, the whale tale outline denotes the largest variance and standard deviation (especially the edges), with some overlap of spots of the largest variance having value of max appearing
